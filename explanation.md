The choice base image is the Node.js alpine image since they are suitable for resource-constrained environments or when minimizing image sizes is a priority of which in this case is a requirement.
Dockerfile directive is that  the base images is node:14-alpine,which the create a working directory to in the path client/app and backend/app ,afterwards the images copy the dependencies from the package.json file run npm install to install any other required dependencies for running the image .The image then copies the filkes in the root of the project .In backend the port 5000 is exposed for viewing results as well as in client the port 3000 is exposed and the results can be viewed from there.
Lastly the CMD commands are run once the image is run.
Since the containers created need to be communicating a network is created for which mine is yolo_net which enable thew containers to communicate once lauched .
Docker volumes that I created enable the data of the containers to be stored outside the container that way to enable persistence even when the container are not running.
Below is a screenshot of the images build when i run docker-compose build and docker-compose push.
